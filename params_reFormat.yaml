              To be, or not to be, that is the question.
              Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
              The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
              Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
              And by opposing end them. To die, to sleep,
              No more; and by a sleep to say we end
              The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
              That flesh is heir to 'tis a consummation
              Devoutly to be wish'd.
